Welcome to the game of NIM!
You have been carefully selected to match wits with the computers attempting to take over the world.
If you LOSE, the machines will destroy humanity. However, if you are the victor then you will save all of mankind. 
Here's how the game works:
  - There are 23 objects which need to be removed.
  - Each player (you and the computer) will alternately get the chance to remove between 1 and 3 pieces.
  - The player to remove the last piece loses.
We will start the game with these 23 objects. >*****  *****  *****  *****  ***<
Player 1 enter your move (1 - 5): 5
Player 1 is making BIG moves by removing 5 objects.
There is now 18 objects remaining. >*****  *****  *****  ***<
I've got a bad feeling about this.
We're getting closer now!
We are nearing the end. We will soon know the fate of humanity
The Computer has made a gutsy call and removed 3 objects. Let's see how this plays out for them.
There is now 15 objects remaining. >*****  *****  *****  <

Incredible! Man has bested machine. The skynet uprising has been narrowly avoided.
Would you like to do another calculation (y/n)?  y
