Welcome to the mysterious labrynth of Ka'a.
The labrynth will lead you through an elaborant network of rooms each with a set of doors leading deeper into the labrynth.
Choose the right combination of doors and you just might make it out alive. Choose poorly and...
Well let's just say you wouldn't be the first to see their final moments in the labrynth.

Along the way look out for treasure to build your stash or riches but beware as danger lurks to wear down your health.

Shall we begin? (y/n)
y

Excellent! Then let us begin!

We begin in a cavernous empty room. The walls are barren gray stone with fleck of mold.
You hear a load 'CRASH!' as the door you entered from closes behind you followed by a quiet but definitive 'klink' signaling that the door is not locked.
Alas, you a different but welcoming door in front of you. What do you do?
  1. Enter the next room through the new door
  2. Try desperately to break free through the door you came in from
Choose 1 or 2.You can also press 0 to see your current health and wealth.
0
Health: 100
Wealth: 0
Choose 1 or 2.You can also press 0 to see your current health and wealth.

You approach the door hesitantly. Before entering you check on your condition and find you have...
Health: 100
Wealth: 0
Now you confidently burst forth into the first room

As your eyes adjust to the darkness of the first room, your face lights up at the site of a treasure chest positioned in the center of the chamber.
You approach the chest and see an inscription that reads: 
   'In this chest lies a treasure the likes of which have never been    
  known to those of mortal beginnings. It holds the highest of power but   
       Can only be wielded by one who knows the magic number.'    

After reading the inscription, what do you do?
  1. Attempt a guess at the magic number and retrieve your treasure...hopefully
  2. Continue looking for a way out
Choose 1 or 2.You can also press 0 to see your current health and wealth.
3
That's not a valid option. Try again!
Choose 1 or 2.You can also press 0 to see your current health and wealth.
2
You look for an exit to the room and realize there are 2 doors on the far side of the room. Which door will you go through?
  1. This door is made of heavy gauge metal and looks heavy to move
  2. This door is made of rainbows and light. An odd make up for a door to be sure.
Choose 1 or 2.You can also press 0 to see your current health and wealth.
2
You push softly against the rainbow but it doesn't budge so you push harder and harder until suddenly you crash through to the other side.
You take a hard spill landing flat on your face!
Health: 90
As you gather yourself off the floor. You notice a giant pile of treasure in the middle of the room and behind it an old, crumbly wooden door.
What do you do?
  1. Gather your treasure.
  2. Go through the creaky old door.
  3. Return the way you came.
Choose 1, 2 or 3.You can also press 0 to see your current health and wealth.

You approach the old wooden door and when reach for the handle when suddenly the game of min magically appears.
You shrug your shoulders and realize you must now beat the game before you can enter the room.Welcome to the game of NIM!
You have been carefully selected to match wits with the computers attempting to take over the world.
If you LOSE, the machines will destroy humanity. However, if you are the victor then you will save all of mankind. 
Here's how the game works:
  - There are 23 objects which need to be removed.
  - Each player (you and the computer) will alternately get the chance to remove between 1 and 3 pieces.
  - The player to remove the last piece loses.
We will start the game with these 23 objects. >*****  *****  *****  *****  ***<
Player 1 enter your move (1 - 5): 5
Player 1 is making BIG moves by removing 5 objects.
There is now 18 objects remaining. >*****  *****  *****  ***<
I've got a bad feeling about this.
We're getting closer now!
We are nearing the end. We will soon know the fate of humanity
The Computer is making BIG moves by removing 4 objects.
There is now 14 objects remaining. >*****  *****  ****<

Incredible! Man has bested machine. The skynet uprising has been narrowly avoided.
Would you like to do another calculation (y/n)?  n
Inside the room you see a pedestal topped with maginificent chalace covered in jewels.
You also notice 2 doors. The closest door, curiously, has a pile of chicken nuggets strewn in from of it.
The second door is best described as the darkest hole in a wall you have ever seen. You hear the squeak of bats and shudder at the thought of an encounter.
What do you do?
  1. Collect the chalace from the pedestal.
  2. Explore the closest door with the chicken nuggets.
  3. Enter the dark hole on the other side of the room.
Choose 1, 2 or 3.You can also press 0 to see your current health and wealth.
3
The chosen_door: 3
You now peer through the dark hole warily but ultimately decide to jump through head first. On the other side you find a giant sign saying...
Congratulations! You survived the labrynth and have proven your valor to all.

Would you like to play again? (y/n)
